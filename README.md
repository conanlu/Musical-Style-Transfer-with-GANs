# Musical Style Transfer with GANs

This project introduces ComposeGAN, a generative adversarial network able to learn and transfer the style elements of various music genres. The initial project, developed from the COSMOS 2019 program, was called GANmidi. I've compiled the code here and added some annotations.

GANMIDI contains the code for this project. "chroma and tonnetz examples" demonstrates the implementation of some visual representations of music.
